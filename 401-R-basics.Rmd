[Pre-Institute Workshop Agenda](#day0agenda)    

This tutorial is an introduction to R adapted from [@Healy:2019:Ch.2] with extra material from [@Matloff:2019]. If you already have R experience, you might still want to browse this section in case you find something new. 

If the prerequisites have been met, the tutorial should take no longer than 50 minutes.  






## Prerequisites {} 

Every tutorial assumes that   

- You completed the [Getting started](#getting-started) instructions  
- You launched `midfield_institute.Rproj` to start the R session 

One of the packages is available only on GitHub. To install it, type in the Console, 

```r
devtools::install_github("kjhealy/socviz")
```

Note on usage: The double-colon notation `package::name` accesses a function from a specific package. In this case, for example, we are accessing the `install_github()` function from the `devtools` package. 


Use *File &gt; New File &gt; R Script* to create a new R script

- Name the script `01-R-basics.R`   
- Save it in the `scripts` directory 
- Add a minimal header at the top of the script (if you wish) 
- Use `library()` to load the packages we will use 

```{r}
# workshop R basics 
# name 
# date 

library("tidyverse")
library("socviz")
```

Run the script by clicking the *Source* button. If you see an error like this one, 

    Error in library("pkg_name") : there is no package called 'pkg_name'

then you should install the missing package(s) and run the script again. 

[[To review how to install an R package]](#install-an-r-package)    


Guidelines 

- As you work through the tutorial, type a line or chunk of code then *File &gt; Save* and *Source.*   
- Confirm that your result matches the tutorial result.  
- **Your turn** exercises give you chance to devise your own examples and check them out. You learn by doing (but you knew that already)!

## Style guide {#style-guide}

A style guide is about making your script readable---which is particularly useful when you ask someone to help you with your script. The following guidelines are adapted from  McConnell [-@McConnell:2004] and Wickham [-@Wickham:2019:styleguide]. 





**Spaces.** Usewhitespacetoenhancereadability. Place spaces around operators (`=`, `+`, `-`, `<-`, etc.). Always put a space after a comma, but never before (just like in regular English). 

```r
# good
height <- (feet * 12) + inches
mean(x, na.rm = 10)

# poor
height<-feet*12+inches
mean(x,na.rm=10)
```

The exception to the "spaces around operators" rule are those with high precedence such as exponentiation (`^`), sequence (`:`), or accessors (`[[` or `$`). These operators are written without spaces,    

```r
# good
sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
x <- 1:10
df$z

# poor
sqrt(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)
x <- 1 : 10
df $ z
```

Adding extra spaces OK if it improves alignment of `=` or `<-`.

```r
# good
list(
    total = a + b + c,
    mean  = (a + b + c) / n
)

# also fine
list(
    total = a + b + c,
    mean = (a + b + c) / n
)
```




**Comments.** Avoid block comments that are hard to maintain, e.g., 

    ####################################################################### 
    ##  class: GigaTron                                                  ## 
    ##                                                                   ## 
    ##  author: Dwight K. Coder                                          ## 
    ##  date: July 4, 2014                                               ## 
    ##                                                                   ## 
    ##  Routines to control the twenty-first century's code evaluation   ## 
    ##  tool. The entry point to these routines is the EvaluateCode()    ## 
    ##  routine at the bottom of this file.                              ## 
    ####################################################################### 

A version of this comment block that is easier to revise and maintain is,  


    #  GigaTron  
    #  Dwight K. Coder  
    #  2014-07-04  
    # 
    #  EvaluateCode() is the entry point for our code evaluation routines 

Avoid writing comments that merely restate the code in English, e.g., 

```r
# set x equal to 1  (poor comment)
x <- 1
```

Instead, write comments that describe the intent of a code paragraph. Such comments are particularly useful when someone other than the code's original author tries to modify the code. 

```r
# swap the roots (good comment)
oldRoot <- root[0]
root[0] <- root[1]
root[1] <- oldRoot
```

Comments should focus on "why" rather than "how". 

```r
# if establishing a new account (good comment)
if (account_type == "new_account") ...

# if account flag is zero (poor comment) 
if (account_flag == 0) ...
```

 




**Blank lines.** Group chunks of code into paragraphs separated by blank lines to reveal the structure of the program. 

```r
# poor 
library("tidyverse");library("GDAdata")
speed_ski<-SpeedSki%>%select(Event,Sex,Speed)%>%as_tibble()%>%
rename(event=Event,sex=Sex,speed=Speed)%>%mutate(event=as_factor(event))%>%
mutate(event=fct_reorder(event,speed))
saveRDS(speed_ski,"data/speedski.rds")

# good
library("tidyverse")
library("GDAdata")

# leave the original data frame unaltered
speed_ski <- SpeedSki

# only three variables needed for analysis 
speed_ski <- SpeedSki %>%
    select(Event, Sex, Speed) %>%
    as_tibble()

# lowercase variable names preferred 
speed_ski <- speed_ski %>%
    rename(event = Event, sex = Sex, speed = Speed)

# event ordered for graph conditioning
speed_ski <- speed_ski %>%
    mutate(event = as_factor(event)) %>%
    mutate(event = fct_reorder(event, speed))

# RDS format preserves factors
saveRDS(speed_ski, "data/speedski.rds")
```








## Everything in R has a name {} 

In R, every object has a name. 

- named entities, like `x` or `y`  
- data you have loaded, like `my_data` 
- functions you use, like `sin()` 

Some names are forbidden 

- reserved words, like `TRUE` or `FALSE`  
- programming words, like `Inf`, `for`, `else`, and `function`  
- special entities, like `NA` and `NaN`  

Some names should not be used because they name commonly used functions 

- `q()`  quit 
- `c()` combine or concatenate 
- `mean()` 
- `range()` 
- `var()` variance 

Names in R are case-sensitive 

- `my_data` and `My_Data` are different objects 
- I follow the style guide used in the tidyverse by naming things in lower case,  with words separated by underscores, and no spaces


If you want to know if a name has already been used in a package you have loaded, go to the RStudio console, type a question mark followed by the name, e.g., 

- `?c()` 
- `?mean()`

If the name is in use, a help page appears in the RStudio Help pane.

## Everything in R is an object  {}

Origins of R objects  

- Some objects are built in to R 
- Some objects are loaded with packages 
- Some objects are created by you 


Type this line of code in your script, Save, Source. `c()` is the function to combine or concatenate its elements to create a vector. 

```{r echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 25)
```

In these notes, everything that comes back to us in the Console as the result of running a script is shown prefaced by `#>`. For example, after running your script, the Console should show, 

```{r echo = FALSE}
c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 25)
```

But what is that `[1]` here? It's just a row label. We'll go into that later, not needed yet.

We can assign the vector to a name. 

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 25)
y <- c(5, 31, 71, 1, 3, 21, 6)
```

To see the result in the Console, type the object name in the script, Save, and Source.  (Remember, type the line of code but not the line prefaced by `#>`---that's the output line so you can check your results.)

```{r}
x

y
```

You create objects my assigning them names 

- `<-` is the assignment operator (keyboard shortcut: ALT --) 
- objects exist in your R project workspace, listed in the RStudio Environment pane 


```{r echo = FALSE}
htmltools::img(src = 
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rstudio-environment-x-y.png"), 
        alt = "rstudio new folder", 
        width = 700)
```

Datasets are also named objects, and a large number of datasets are included in the base R installation. For example,`LakeHuron` contains annual measurements of the lake level, in feet, from 1875--1972. 

```{r}
LakeHuron
```

Now you can see how the row labels work. There are 10 numbers per row, here, so the second row starts with the 11th, indicated by `[11]`. The last row starts with the 91st value `[91]` and ends with the 98th value. 

- In the Console, type `? LakeHuron` to see the help page for the data set 

Individual elements of a vector are obtained using `[]` notation. 

For example, the first five lake level readings are extracted with 

```{r}
LakeHuron[1:5]
```

The 4th element alone, 

```{r}
LakeHuron[4]
```

## Do things in R using functions  {}

Functions do something useful 

- functions are objects the perform actions for you 
- functions produce output based on the input it receives 
- functions are recognized by the parentheses at the end of their names 

The parentheses are where we include the inputs (arguments) to the function 

- `c()` concatenates the comma-separated numbers in the parentheses to create a vector 
- `mean()` computes the mean of a vector of numbers 
- `sd()` computes the standard deviation of a vector of numbers 
- `summary()` returns a summary of the object 

If we try `mean()` with no inputs, we get an error statement 


    mean()
    #> Error in mean.default() : argument "x" is missing, with no default

If we use the Lake Huron dataset as the argument, the function is computed and displayed. Add these lines to your script, Save, and Source.

```{r}
mean(LakeHuron)

sd(LakeHuron)

summary(LakeHuron)
```


We can extract subsets of data using functions. For example, If we wanted only the first five even-numbered elements, we use `c()` to create a vector of indices to the desired elements, 

```{r}
LakeHuron[c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)]
```

If we wanted every 5th entry over the full data set, we use `length()` to determine how many entries there are, and the sequence function `seq()` to create the vector of indices, 

```{r}
n <- length(LakeHuron)
LakeHuron[seq(from = 5, to = n, by = 5)]
```


Because we will be using the ggplot2 package for graphics, we will not be using the base R `plot()` function very often, but it is useful for a quick look at data. Add these lines to your script, Save, and Source. 

```{r}
plot(LakeHuron)
```

The help pages for functions are quickly accessed via the Console. In the Console type one line at a time and *Enter* to see the function help page. 

- `?mean()` 
- `?sd()` 
- `?summary()`

## R functions come in packages {}

Functions are bundled in packages  

- Families of useful functions are bundled into packages that you can install, load, and use 
- Packages allow you to build on the work of others 
- You can write your own functions and packages too 
- A lot of the work in data science consists of choosing the right functions and giving them the right arguments to get our data into the form we need for analysis or visualization 

Functions operate on the input you provide and give you back a result. Type the following in your script, Save, and Source.

```{r}
table(x) # table of counts

sd(y)    # standard deviation

x * 5    # multiply every element by a scalar

y + 1    # add a scalar to every element

x + x    # add elements 
```

*Comments* are annotations to make the source code easier for humans to understand but are ignored by R. Comments in R are denoted by a hashtag `#`.

## R objects have class {}

Everything is an object and every object has a class. 

```{r}
class(x)

class(summary)
```

Certain actions will change the class of an object. Suppose we try create a vector from the `x` object and a text string, 

```{r}
new_vector <- c(x, "Apple")

new_vector

class(new_vector)
```

By adding the word "Apple" to the vector, R changed the class from "numeric" to "character". All the numbers are enclosed in quotes: they are now character strings and cannot be used in calculations. 

The most common class of data object we will use is the data frame. 

```{r}
titanic # data in the socviz package

class(titanic)
```

You can see there are four variables: `r names(titanic)`.  Two variables (columns) are numeric, two are categorical. 

You can pick variable out of a data frame using the `$` operator, 

```{r}
titanic$percent
```

From the tidyverse, we will regularly use a augmented data frame called a *tibble.* We can convert the titanic data frame to a tibble using  `as_tibble()`. 

```{r}
titanic_tb <- as_tibble(titanic)

class(titanic_tb)

titanic_tb
```

The tibble includes additional information about the variables











<br>    
[&#9650; top of page](#r-basics)  









## R objects have structure {}


To see inside an object ask for its structure using the `str()` function. 

```{r}
str(x)

str(titanic)

str(titanic_tb)
```

I also like to use the `glimpse()` function from the tidyverse. 

```{r}
glimpse(x)

glimpse(titanic)

glimpse(titanic_tb) 
```

## R does what you tell it {}

Expect to make errors and don't worry when that happens.  You won't break anything. Healy [-@Healy:2019] offers this advice for three specific things to watch out for: 

- Make sure parentheses are balanced---that every opening `(` has a corresponding closing `)`.  
- Make sure you complete your expressions. If you see a `+` in the Console instead of the usual prompt `>`, that means that R thinks you haven't written a complete expression. You can hit `Esc` or `Ctrl C` to force your way back to the Console and try correcting the code.  
- In ggplot specifically, as you will see, we create plots layer by layer, using a `+` character at the end of the line---not at the beginning of the next line. 

For example, you would write this, 

```r
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    geom_point()
```

not this,  

```r  
# error caused by incorrectly placed +
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy))  
    + geom_point()
```

To conclude, let's make bar graph of the `titanic` data, 

```{r fig.asp = 1/3}
ggplot(data = titanic_tb, mapping = aes(x = sex, y = n, fill = fate)) +
        geom_col() +
        coord_flip()
```


> **Your turn.** As shown, color distinguishes those who survived from those who did not and bar length gives totals by sex. Make a small change so that color denotes sex and bar length gives totals of survived and perished.

## Pipe operator 

`%>%` is the pipe operator from the magrittr package, part of the tidyverse suite of packages. 

The pipe takes the output of one statement and makes it the input of the next statement. You can think of it as the word “then”. In this example, we'll use the `starwars` dataset from the dplyr package, 

```{r}
glimpse(starwars)
```

The following code chunk

```r
starwars %>%
        count(homeworld) 
```

could be read as, 

- start with the `starwars` object, then  
- count the number of observations `n` by homeworld 

Because each observation in `starwars` is a person, `count()` yields the number of people from a given homeworld. The result is: 

```{r echo = FALSE}
starwars %>%
        count(homeworld) 
```

The pipe makes a sequence of operations easy to construct and easy to read, 

```r
starwars %>%
        count(homeworld) %>% 
        arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
        filter(n >= 3) %>% 
        drop_na()
```

which can be read as, 

- start with the `starwars` object, then 
- count the number of observations `n` by homeworld, then 
- arrange the rows in descending order of `n`, then  
- filter to keep all rows where $n \ge 3$, then  
- drop rows with NA  

The output is 

```{r echo = FALSE}
starwars %>%
        count(homeworld) %>% 
        arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
        filter(n >= 3) %>% 
        drop_na()
```

## Keyboard shortcuts {}

In Windows, 

- `Ctrl L` clears the Console  
- `Alt -` creates the assignment operator `<-`  
- `Ctrl Enter` runs the selected line(s) of code in an R script
