## Description {-}

We are offering the first Multiple Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development (MIDFIELD) Institute on Monday, June 3, and Tuesday, June 4, 2019 in West Lafayette, Indiana. We welcome faculty, staff, and graduate students.

The cost for the MIDFIELD Institute will be $250 including breakfast and lunch both days and a reception on June 3.  Participants will be responsible for their travel and hotel arrangements.  More details will be available soon.  A limited number of travel stipends might be available.  



Our learning objectives are categorized in two broad classes: qualitative and computational. Qualitatively, by the end of the workshop participants should be able to: 

1. Describe data available in MIDFIELD 
1. Identify deficiencies of common graph types 
1. Describe key principles of effective data visualization 
1. List potential resources beyond MIDFIELD that can contribute to answering research questions 

Computationaly, participants should be able use the **midfieldr** R package to work with the MIDFIELD dataset to:

1. Calculate and evaluate educational metrics 
1. Explore and tell a story from MIDFIELD data
1. Produce a table of MIDFIELD data that addresses a research question
