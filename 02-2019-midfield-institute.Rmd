## Description {-}

We are offering the first Multiple Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development (MIDFIELD) Institute on Monday June 3 and Tuesday June 4, 2019 in West Lafayette, Indiana. 

We welcome faculty, staff, and graduate students.  

Our learning objectives can be categorized in two broad classes: qualitative and computational. Qualitatively, by the end of the workshop participants should be able to: 

1. Describe the data available in MIDFIELD  
1. Describe how the MIDFIELD data are organized  
1. Describe key principles of effective data visualization  
1. Identify deficiencies of common graph types  
1. List potential resources beyond MIDFIELD that can contribute to answering research questions  
 
 Computationally, participants should be able use **midfieldr**, an R package specifically designed for use with MIDFIELD, to:

1. Calculate and evaluate educational metrics  
1. Produce a table of data that addresses a research question  
1. Explore and tell a story from MIDFIELD data  







## Before you arrive {-}


- [Preface](https://midfieldr.github.io/workshops/index.html) for an introduction to MIDFIELD and the workshop facilitators. 
- [Getting started](https://midfieldr.github.io/workshops/getting-started.html) for pre-workshop software installation instructions---assuming you plan on using your own laptop. If not, we will have computers available onsite. 
- Optional: For several years now, we have been using R to explore and present the stories in the MIDFIELD data. To see a sample of our data graphics, you can follow the links in the [publications] section.   














## Day 0 agenda  {-}

Sunday, 2019-06-02. 

This is an optional session designed for R novices or for anyone whose R skills are rusty. We cover the basics of data carpentry using the tidyverse packages and data graphics using ggplot2. 

We will provide pizza. 

To make the best use of our time, please follow the [Getting started](https://midfieldr.github.io/workshops/getting-started.html) instructions before arriving.  

You are welcome to attend all or part of this session.
