## Data basics {#data-basics}  

<!-- Use  knitr:: child = to include as a section in a chapter-->

```{r include = FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 6, 
        out.width = "70%", 
        fig.align = "center", 
        fig.asp   = 0.618, 
        comment   = "#>", 
        warning   = FALSE, 
        message   = FALSE)

library("tidyverse")
```

If the prerequisites have been met, the tutorial should take no longer than 50 minutes.  

Preparing data for graphs starts with four basic skills

```{r echo = FALSE}
library("magick")
image_read("figures/sd021-09.png") %>% 
        image_scale("200") %>% 
        image_write(., path = "figures/data-basics-01.png")
image_read("figures/sd021-02.png") %>% 
        image_scale("200") %>% 
        image_write(., path = "figures/data-basics-02.png")
image_read("figures/sd011-14.png") %>% 
        image_scale("x200") %>%  
        image_write(., path = "figures/data-basics-03a.png")
image_read("figures/sd011-14b.png") %>% 
        image_scale("x200")  %>%        
        image_write(., path = "figures/data-basics-03b.png") 
image_read("figures/sd021-01.png") %>% 
        image_scale("200") %>% 
        image_write(., path = "figures/data-basics-04.png")

img3a <- image_read("figures/data-basics-03a.png")
img3b <- image_read("figures/data-basics-03b.png")
image_append(c(img3a, img3b), stack = FALSE) %>% 
        image_scale("200") %>% 
        image_write(., path = "figures/data-basics-03.png")


df6 <- wrapr::build_frame(
                "filename"             , "item"|
                "data-basics-01.png"   , "Obtain the raw data"|
                "data-basics-02.png"   , "Read the raw data into R and examine it"|
                "data-basics-03.png"   , "Identify the structure of the data"|
                "data-basics-04.png"   , "Tidy the data and write to file") %>%
        mutate(image = str_c("![](figures/", filename, ")")) %>%
        select(-filename) %>%
        select(image, item)

kable(df6, col.names = NULL, align = 'll')
```


### Data sources

**Online, open-source data.** While we won't be using external data sources like these in today's work, we thought you might appreciate having a glimpse of what is available. Here is a small sample of online, open-data sources: 

- [Center for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/datastatistics/index.html)  
- [Global Health Observatory](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.home) World Health Organization (WHO) data repository
- [Human Mortality Database](http://www.mortality.org/) detailed mortality and population data  
- [OECD Data](https://data.oecd.org/) Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
- [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) Datasets used in its articles available via GitHub repository
- [Guardian Datablog](https://www.theguardian.com/data) Provides a lot of free-to-use data via Google spreadsheets.
- [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) Data in Gapminder World (over 500 entries).
- [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) US Census Bureau  
- [Bureau of Justice](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=abu) statistics and data.
- [Open.canada.ca](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data) Canadian Government open data  
- [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/) US Government open data  
- [Data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/) Australian government open data  
- [Data.gov.nz](https://data.gov.nz/) New Zealand government open data    
- [Data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/) UK government open data

**Practice data sets in R.** Practice data sets are included with the basic R installation and with some R packages. 

To list the practice data sets available in R, type in the Console, 

```r 
data() # to list data sets in base R 
```

yields 

     #> AirPassengers  Monthly Airline Passenger Numbers
     #> BJsales        Sales Data with Leading Indicator
     #> BOD            Biochemical Oxygen Demand
     #> CO2            Carbon Dioxide Uptake in Grass Plants
     #> Formaldehyde   Determination of Formaldehyde
     etc.

To list the practice data sets available in an R package (if any), type in the Console, 

```r 
data(package = "dplyr") # to list data sets an R package 
```

yields

     #> band_instruments   Band membership
     #> band_instruments2  Band membership
     #> band_members       Band membership
     #> nasa               NASA spatio-temporal data
     #> starwars           Starwars characters
     #> storms             Storm tracks data

Every data set in base R and in R packages has a help page that describes format of the data and the variable names with short descriptions. Type in the Console a question mark followed by the name of the data set, e.g., 

```r
library("dplyr")
? starwars
```

yields

```{r echo = FALSE}
htmltools::img(src = knitr::include_graphics("figures/starwars-help-page.png"),
               alt   = 'starwars help page',
               style = 'left:0px; padding:0px;',
               width = 600)
```


<br>
Data in base R and in R packages are automatically loaded 

- Launching R loads all data sets in base R  
- Loading a package with `library()` loads all the data sets in the package  
- All other data files have to be read or web-scraped  explicitly 


  


### Obtain raw data 


### Read data into R 


### Identify the structure 


### Reshape data
