MIDFIELD is the Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development—a student record database with approximately one million undergraduate students at sixteen US institutions from 1987 to 2016. midfieldr is a R package that provides functions for turning raw MIDFIELD data into persistence metrics. midfielddata is an R package that provides a stratified sample of the MIDFIELD data: registrars’ student records for 98,000 undergraduate students with proportional representation by institution, program, transfer status, sex, and race/ethnicity.
