Facilitators Acknowledgment", " MIDFIELD Workshops 2019-04-22 Preface This site provides access to workshop materials for studying how undergraduate students maneuver through their curricula using MIDFIELD data (Ohland and Long 2016). The software environment is R (2018) and RStudio (2016). MIDFIELD (Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development) is a partnership of higher education institutions with engineering programs. MIDFIELD contains student record data from 1988–2017 for approximately one million undergraduate, degree-seeking students at the partner institutions. midfielddata is an R package that provides a stratified sample of the MIDFIELD data. This data package contains student records for 98,000 students, suitable for practice with the midfieldr package. midfieldr is a R package that provides functions for turning student-record data into persistence metrics. Why R? R is an open source language and environment for statistical computing and graphics (R Core Team 2018), ranked by IEEE in 2018 as the 7th most popular programming language (Python, C++, and Java are the top three) (Cass 2018). If you are new to R, some of its best features, paraphrasing Wickham (2014), are: R is free, open source, and available on every major platform, making it easy for others to replicate your work. More than 13,000 open-source R packages are available (October 2018). Many are cutting-edge tools. R packages provide deep-seated support for data analysis, e.g., missing values, data frames, and subsetting. R packages provide powerful tools for communicating results via html, pdf, docx, or interactive websites. It is easy to get help from experts in the R community. RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, includes a console, editor, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management as well as access to GitHub for collaboration and version control (RStudio Team 2016). Facilitators Matthew Ohland is the MIDFIELD Director and Principal Investigator. He is Professor and Associate Head of Engineering Education at Purdue University. Marisa Orr is the MIDFIELD Associate Director and Assistant Professor in Engineering and Science Education with a joint appointment in Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University. Russell Long is MIDFIELD Managing Director and Data Steward. He developed the stratified data sample for the R packages used in this workshop. Susan Lord is Director of the MIDFIELD Institute and Professor and Chair of Engineering and Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of San Diego. Richard Layton is the MIDFIELD Director of Data Display and Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Rose-Hulman. He is the lead developer of the R packages used in this workshop.
