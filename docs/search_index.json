Facilitators Acknowledgment", " MIDFIELD Workshops 2018-10-05 Preface This site provides access to workshop materials for studying how undergraduate students maneuver through their curricula using data from the MIDFIELD project (Ohland and Long 2016). The software environment for statistical computing and graphics is R (2018) and RStudio (2016). MIDFIELD is the Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development—a student record database with approximately one million undergraduate students at sixteen US institutions from 1987 to 2016. midfieldr is a R package that provides functions for turning raw MIDFIELD data into persistence metrics. midfielddata is an R package that provides a stratified sample of the MIDFIELD data: registrars’ student records for 98,000 undergraduate students with proportional representation by institution, program, transfer status, sex, and race/ethnicity. Why R? R is an open source language and environment for statistical computing and graphics (R Core Team 2018), ranked by IEEE (2018 July) as the 7th most popular programming language (Python, C++, and Java are the top three) (Cass 2018). If you are new to R, some of its best features, paraphrasing Wickham (2014), are: R is free, open source, and available on every major platform, making it easy for others to replicate your work. More than 12,500 open-source R packages are available (April 2018). Many are cutting-edge tools. R packages provide deep-seated support for data analysis, e.g., missing values, data frames, and subsetting. R packages provide powerful tools for communicating results via html, pdf, docx, or interactive websites. It is easy to get help from experts in the R community. RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, includes a console, editor, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management as well as access to GitHub for collaboration and version control (RStudio Team 2016). The fundamental unit of shareable code in R is the package. A package bundles code, data, documentation, and tests, and is easily shared with others (Wickham 2014). In this workshop, we work with the open-source midfieldr package and associated data packages, all of which are available for Windows, MacOSX, and Linux platforms from CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network, n.d.). Facilitators Richard Layton is the MIDFIELD Director of Data Display and Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Rose-Hulman. He is the lead developer of the R packages used in this workshop. Dr. Layton has considerable experience facilitating workshops for data visualization, including a workshop for R beginners at the 2014 FIE in Madrid. Russell Long is MIDFIELD Managing Director and Data Steward. He developed the stratified data sample for the R packages used in this workshop. Mr. Long is a SAS expert with over twenty years of experience in institutional research and assessment. Susan Lord is Director of the MIDFIELD Institute and Professor and Chair of Engineering and Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of San Diego. She is a Fellow of the IEEE and the ASEE. Dr. Lord has considerable experience facilitating workshops including the National Effective Teaching Institute (NETI) and special sessions at FIE. Matthew Ohland is the MIDFIELD Director and Principal Investigator. He is Professor and Associate Head of Engineering Education at Purdue University and a Fellow of IEEE, ASEE, and AAAS. Dr. Ohland has considerable experience facilitating workshops including the NETI and CATME training. Marisa Orr is the MIDFIELD Associate Director and Assistant Professor in Engineering and Science Education with a joint appointment in Mechanical Engineering at Clemson university. She is a recipient of the 2009 Helen Plants Award for the best nontraditional session at FIE (Enhancing Student Learning Using SCALE-UP Format).
