["index.html", "MIDFIELD Workshops Facilitators Publications Licenses Acknowledgement", " MIDFIELD Workshops The Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development (MIDFIELD) is a partnership of higher education institutions with engineering programs. MIDFIELD contains student record data from 1988–2017 for approximately one million undergraduate, degree-seeking students at the partner institutions. This site provides access to workshop materials for studying how undergraduate students maneuver through their curricula using MIDFIELD data. [For more information about MIDFIELD] Facilitators Matthew Ohland is the MIDFIELD Director and Principal Investigator. He is Professor and Associate Head of Engineering Education at Purdue University. Marisa Orr is the MIDFIELD Associate Director and Assistant Professor in Engineering and Science Education with a joint appointment in Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University. Russell Long is MIDFIELD Managing Director and Data Steward. He developed the stratified data sample for the R packages used in this workshop. Susan Lord is Director of the MIDFIELD Institute and Professor and Chair of Engineering and Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of San Diego. Richard Layton is the MIDFIELD Director of Data Display and Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Rose-Hulman. He is the lead developer of the R packages used in this workshop.
