Facilitators Acknowledgment", " MIDFIELD Workshops 2018-09-23 Preface This site provides access to workshop materials for studying how undergraduate students maneuver through their curricula using data from the MIDFIELD project (Ohland and Long 2016). The software environment for statistical computing and graphics is R (2018) and RStudio (2016). MIDFIELD is the Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development—a student record database with approximately one million undergraduate students at sixteen US institutions from 1987 to 2016. midfieldr is a R package that provides functions for turning raw MIDFIELD data into persistence metrics. midfielddata is an R package that provides a stratified sample of the MIDFIELD data: registrars’ student records for 98,000 undergraduate students with proportional representation by institution, program, transfer status, sex, and race/ethnicity. Why R? R is an open source language and environment for statistical computing and graphics (R Core Team 2018), currently ranked by IEEE as the 6th most popular programming language (Python, C, and Java are the top three) (Cass 2017). If you are new to R, some of its best features, paraphrasing Wickham (2014), are: R is free, open source, and available on every major platform, making it easy for others to replicate your work. More than 12,500 open-source R packages are available (April 2018). Many are cutting-edge tools. R packages provide deep-seated support for data analysis, e.g., missing values, data frames, and subsetting. R packages provide powerful tools for communicating results via html, pdf, docx, or interactive websites. It is easy to get help from experts in the R community. RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, includes a console, editor, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management as well as access to GitHub for collaboration and version control (RStudio Team 2016). The fundamental unit of shareable code in R is the package. A package bundles code, data, documentation, and tests, and is easily shared with others (Wickham 2014). In this workshop, we work with the open-source midfieldr package and associated data packages, all of which are available for Windows, MacOSX, and Linux platforms from CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network, n.d.). Facilitators Richard Layton is the MIDFIELD Director of Data Display and Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Rose-Hulman. He is the lead developer of the R packages used in this workshop. Dr. Layton has considerable experience facilitating workshops for data visualization, including a workshop for R beginners at the 2014 FIE in Madrid. Russell Long is MIDFIELD Managing Director and Data Steward. He developed the stratified data sample for the R packages used in this workshop. Mr. Long is a SAS expert with over twenty years of experience in institutional research and assessment. Susan Lord is Director of the MIDFIELD Institute and Professor and Chair of Engineering and Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of San Diego. She is a Fellow of the IEEE and the ASEE. Dr. Lord has considerable experience facilitating workshops including the National Effective Teaching Institute (NETI) and special sessions at FIE. Matthew Ohland is the MIDFIELD Director and Principal Investigator. He is Professor and Associate Head of Engineering Education at Purdue University and a Fellow of IEEE, ASEE, and AAAS. Dr. Ohland has considerable experience facilitating workshops including the NETI and CATME training. Marisa Orr is the MIDFIELD Associate Director and Assistant Professor in Engineering and Science Education with a joint appointment in Mechanical Engineering at Clemson university. She is a recipient of the 2009 Helen Plants Award for the best nontraditional session at FIE (Enhancing Student Learning Using SCALE-UP Format).

["getting-started.html", "Getting started Install R and RStudio Installing an R package Install the MIDFIELD packages", " Getting started Unless noted otherwise, we assume throughout that the workshop attendee is an R novice. Thus the first steps are to install R and RStudio. Install R and RStudio Windows users may have to login as an Administrator (localmgr) before installing the software. Install R for your OS: https://cloud.r-project.org Install RStudio, a user interface for R: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop If you already have R and RStudio installed, please update to the most recent releases and update your R packages as well. If you need additional assistance for Mac OS or Linux, these links might be useful Install R and RStudio on Mac OS by Michael Galarnyk (or you can Google more recent instructions) How to Install R Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial by Kris Eberwein (or you can Google more recent instructions) Installing an R package If you know how to install R packages, you can go directly to the next section. For the R novice, an R package is like an “app” for R—a collection of functions, data, and documentation for doing work in R. To install a package using RStudio, Launch RStudio The RStudio interface has several panes. Find the window pane with the Packages tab. Select the Packages tab Click Install In the dialog box, Type the name of the package, for example, drat (a package we use to access the midfield data) Select the Install dependencies check-box Click Install This approach is suitable for any package that resides in the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) package repository. Some packages, like midfielddata are too large to be stored in CRAN, so we use a special “drat-repository” to make the package source files available. To install the packages, place your cursor in the RStudio Console pane. In the console, at the cursor (indicated by &gt;), type each of the following lines of code and press Enter from your keyboard, one line at a time. Alternatively, you can copy a line of code from this page, paste it in the console, and press Enter. drat::addRepo(&quot;midfieldr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;midfielddata&quot;) install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;MIDFIELDR/midfieldr&quot;) If you successfully negotiated this section, you can skip the next section because you have installed the packages we need to get started. Install the MIDFIELD packages If you know how to install R package, follow the instructions at https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr to install drat devtools midfielddata midfieldr At the moment, midfieldr is only available from GitHub. Once the package has been submitted to CRAN, you can download it and update it from CRAN. "],
["fie-workshop.html", "2018 FIE Workshop Description Agenda Sample result", " 2018 FIE Workshop Workshop conducted at the 2018 Frontiers in Education Conference (2018-10-03) in San Jose, CA. The goal of the workshop is to share our data, methods, and metrics for intersectional research in student persistence. The workshop is designed for R beginners. Preface for an introduction to MIDFIELD and the workshop facilitators. Getting started for pre-workshop software installation instructions. Description The goal of the workshop is to make MIDFIELD more accessible to the FIE community via midfieldr. On completing the workshop, participants should be able to Describe key variables in the MIDFIELD data Select academic programs and populations to study Use R to compute and graph persistence metrics (e.g., graduation rate) Explain key features of effective data displays Continue using midfieldr to study additional persistence metrics Participants should be sufficiently familiar with their operating systems to install software and navigate directories, but prior experience with R is not required. Agenda Workshop activities include think-pair share, active learning, demonstration, discussion, and self-paced software tutorials. Our 3-hour agenda includes: Min Topic 10 Introductions 30 Designing effective data displays (interactive) 20 Getting started with R (interactive) 20 Break 20 Exploring the structure of the MIDFIELD data sample 45 Using R for persistence metrics (self-paced tutorial) 15 Additional persistence metrics using R 20 Discussing next steps and assessing the workshop Sample result A common example of a persistence metric is graduation rate: the fraction of starters in a major who graduate in the major. The figure shows graduation rates for students in three majors—Industrial Engineering (ISE), Mechanical Engineering (MCE), and Electrical Engineering (ELE)—disaggregated by sex and race/ethnicity. Figure 1: Graduation rates of students in three engineering majors. The rows of this graph are ordered by the mean graduation rate of each student group across all three panels, allowing us to detect visual anomalies. For example, Hispanic Female students in ISE graduate at a much higher rate than expected given their average rate across all three majors. Data of this type are multiway data and the graph is a multiway dot plot (Cleveland 1993). Because persistence data often have a multiway structure, we regularly use this graph type for data exploration and presentation (Layton, Lord, and Ohland 2009) and we include it as a default graph type in midfieldr.
