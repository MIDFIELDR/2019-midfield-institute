The software environment is R (2018) and RStudio (2016). 1.1 What is MIDFIELD? MIDFIELD (Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development) is a partnership of higher education institutions with engineering programs. MIDFIELD contains student record data from 1988–2017 for approximately one million undergraduate, degree-seeking students at the partner institutions.

The R package midfieldr provides an entry to this type of intersectional research for anyone willing to develop basic proficiency in R. midfieldr is a R package that provides functions for turning student-record data into persistence metrics. midfielddata is an R package that provides a stratified sample of the MIDFIELD data. This data package contains student records for 98,000 students, suitable for practice with the midfieldr package.

R is an open source language and environment for statistical computing and graphics (R Core Team, 2018), ranked by IEEE in 2018 as the 7th most popular programming language (Python, C++, and Java are the top three) (Cass, 2018). If you are new to R, some of its best features, paraphrasing Wickham (2014), are: R is free, open source, and available on every major platform, making it easy for others to replicate your work. More than 14,000 open-source R packages are available (April 2019). Many are cutting-edge tools. R packages provide deep-seated support for data analysis, e.g., missing values, data frames, and subsetting. R packages provide powerful tools for communicating results via html, pdf, docx, or interactive websites. It is easy to get help from experts in the R community. RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, includes a console, editor, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management as well as access to GitHub for collaboration and version control (RStudio Team, 2016). [For more information about R] 1.4 Why R graphics? Charles Kostelnick (2007) writes, “The array of design options in software like Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint creates the illusion of flexibility. … So marvelously malleable are these graphical effects—but for whom and to what end? Paradoxically, then, even as the technology for visualizing data has become more sophisticated, it does not necessarily engender rhetorically sensitive design.” The graphics tools in R provide the means to control every pixel in the service of “rhetorically sensitive design.” Designers can craft their visual arguments to balance logos, ethos, pathos, and kairos as appropriate for a given audience in a given rhetorical situation.

As John Tukey (1977) put it, “The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.” The MIDFIELD team has been using R to explore and present the stories in the MIDFIELD data for several years.
