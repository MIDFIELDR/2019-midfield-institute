The goal of the workshop is to share our data, methods, and metrics for intersectional research in student persistence. The workshop is designed for R beginners. Pre-workshop setup Getting started for pre-workshop software installation instructions. Preface for an introduction to MIDFIELD and the workshop facilitators. Description The goal of the workshop is to make MIDFIELD more accessible to the FIE community via midfieldr. On completing the workshop, participants should be able to Describe key variables in the MIDFIELD data Select academic programs and populations to study Use R to compute and graph persistence metrics (e.g., graduation rate) Explain key features of effective data displays Continue using midfieldr to study additional persistence metrics Participants should be sufficiently familiar with their operating systems to install software and navigate directories, but prior experience with R is not required. Agenda Workshop activities include think-pair share, active learning, demonstration, discussion, and self-paced software tutorials. Our 3-hour agenda includes: Min Topic 10 Introductions 30 Elements of effective graphs 20 Getting started with R (tutorial) 10 Accessing the MIDFIELD data 20 — break — 50 Using midfieldr (tutorial) 20 Extending your repertoire 20 Next steps Tutorial: Getting started with R 1. Create an R project Open RStudio. File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; New Project Fill in the Directory Name text box with 2018-FIE-midfieldr-workshop Select a location on your computer to save the project Check the Open in a new session box Click Create Project The new project directory will be all of these things: a directory or “folder” on your computer an RStudio Project On your computer, if you navigate to the new project folder, you should have at least the following folders and files, 2018-FIE-midfieldr-workshop/ `-- 2018-FIE-midfieldr-workshop.Rproj Always begin an R work session by opening the project’s Rproj file. Let’s practice: First, close all RStudio windows Navigate to the workshop folder you jst created Open 2018-FIE-midfieldr-workshop.Rproj We work within an R project because it automatically sets project directory as the R working directory. Set project options Tools &gt; Global Options. Figure from R for Data Science Optional reading: To read all about R Projects, see the RStudio support page. 2. Create an R script If you closed the project, then open 2018-FIE-midfieldr-workshop.Rproj File &gt; New File &gt; R Script An Untitled script will open File &gt; Save As Type in a file name, for example, get-started.R Save In this workshop, all files we create will be saved in the main project folder, with no subdirectories. If you prefer to use subdirectories (folders) inside the project, that’s OK. In the R file, type library(tidyverse) To run the script, Save Click the Run button to run a selected line or lines of code Click Source to run the entire script If you get an error statement that the package does not exist, you probably have to install the package. In the RStudio, console, just type install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) When the script runs correctly, you should see set of messages like this, -- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.2.1 -- v ggplot2 3.0.0.9000 v purrr 0.2.5 v tibble 1.4.2 v dplyr 0.7.6 v tidyr 0.8.1 v stringr 1.3.1 v readr 1.1.1 v forcats 0.3.0 -- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() -- x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() 3. Look at a tibble The tidyverse comes with several data sets. We will use the one called diamonds. To get a glimpse of the data, just type its name in the script and run it. mpg ## # A tibble: 234 x 11 ## manufacturer model displ year cyl trans drv cty hwy fl cla~ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;ch&gt; ## 1 audi a4 1.8 1999 4 auto~ f 18 29 p com~ ## 2 audi a4 1.8 1999 4 manu~ f 21 29 p com~ ## 3 audi a4 2 2008 4 manu~ f 20 31 p com~ ## 4 audi a4 2 2008 4 auto~ f 21 30 p com~ ## 5 audi a4 2.8 1999 6 auto~ f 16 26 p com~ ## 6 audi a4 2.8 1999 6 manu~ f 18 26 p com~ ## 7 audi a4 3.1 2008 6 auto~ f 18 27 p com~ ## 8 audi a4 q~ 1.8 1999 4 manu~ 4 18 26 p com~ ## 9 audi a4 q~ 1.8 1999 4 auto~ 4 16 25 p com~ ## 10 audi a4 q~ 2 2008 4 manu~ 4 20 28 p com~ ## # ... with 224 more rows In this tutorial, R output is indicated by a double hashtag (##). The result tells us that the data has 11 variables (columns) 234 observations (rows) manufacturer is a variable of type “character” displ is a variable of type “double” year is a variable of type “integer” In a tidy data frame, every column is a variable and every row is an observation. The mpg data is in tidy form. A data frame is 2-dimensional data structure with columns of equal lengths. Columns can be of different types (numeric, character, logical, etc.) but all values in a column are the same type. Data frames are the most common way of storing data in R. Optional reading: Data frames. For the sake of our R beginners, we will not belabor the differences between a data frame and a tibble. Tibbles are data frames, but they tweak some older behaviors to make life a little easier. Optional reading: Tibbles. 4. Assignment operator In R we assign values to objects with the assignment operator, &lt;-. For example, suppose we want to assign the value \\(\\pi/4\\) to the object \\(x\\). # an angle in radians x &lt;- pi Type the object name x to see it’s value. ## [1] 3.141593 5. Functions Functions are fundamental building blocks in R. Functions carry out specified tasks, typically operating on one or more arguments. For example, the cosine function, cos(), has one argument, cos(x) ## [1] -1 The help page for a function is found by typing (in the RStudio console pane) a question mark followed by the function name. For example, ?cos(). A function from the tidyverse that we will use regularly is glimpse(). It gives us a useful glimpse of a data frame, showing all the variables (column names) but written down the page, and data runs across the page. making it possible to see every column in a data frame. For example, glimpse(diamonds) ## Observations: 53,940 ## Variables: 10 ## $ carat &lt;dbl&gt; 0.23, 0.21, 0.23, 0.29, 0.31, 0.24, 0.24, 0.26, 0.22, ... ## $ cut &lt;ord&gt; Ideal, Premium, Good, Premium, Good, Very Good, Very G... ## $ color &lt;ord&gt; E, E, E, I, J, J, I, H, E, H, J, J, F, J, E, E, I, J, ... ## $ clarity &lt;ord&gt; SI2, SI1, VS1, VS2, SI2, VVS2, VVS1, SI1, VS2, VS1, SI... ## $ depth &lt;dbl&gt; 61.5, 59.8, 56.9, 62.4, 63.3, 62.8, 62.3, 61.9, 65.1, ... ## $ table &lt;dbl&gt; 55, 61, 65, 58, 58, 57, 57, 55, 61, 61, 55, 56, 61, 54... ## $ price &lt;int&gt; 326, 326, 327, 334, 335, 336, 336, 337, 337, 338, 339,... ## $ x &lt;dbl&gt; 3.95, 3.89, 4.05, 4.20, 4.34, 3.94, 3.95, 4.07, 3.87, ... ## $ y &lt;dbl&gt; 3.98, 3.84, 4.07, 4.23, 4.35, 3.96, 3.98, 4.11, 3.78, ... ## $ z &lt;dbl&gt; 2.43, 2.31, 2.31, 2.63, 2.75, 2.48, 2.47, 2.53, 2.49, ... The general form of a function is function_name(arg1 = value, arg2 = value, ... ) 6. Graphs We use the ggplot() function from the tidyverse for creating graphs. For example, add the following lines to your script and run the code. ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_point() These lines are instructions to the ggplot() function to use the mpg data frame map the the displ and hwy variables from the data frame as the x and y variables of the scatter plot + adds a new layer to the graph geom_point() assigns points as the data markers 7. Saving results to a file We can save any result to file, for example, to save the graph we just made as a PNG image, we write ggsave(&quot;mileage.png&quot;) To save a data frame as a CSV file, write_csv(mpg, &quot;mpg_data.csv&quot;) Add these lines to your scrupt and run it. If you examine your project folder you will find the PNG and CSV files your just made. Your directory should look like this now, 2018-FIE-midfieldr-workshop/ |-- mpg_data.csv |-- mileage.png `-- 2018-FIE-midfieldr-workshop.Rproj 8. More graph stuff We can use a 3rd variable in the data frame, the variable class, as a conditioning variable to graph a separate x-y graph for each class of vehivle, using the facet_wrap() function as a new layer to the graph. ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(vars(class)) Or, instaed of class, we could condition using the number of cylinders in the engine. ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(vars(cyl)) If we aren’t intersested in 5-cylinder cars (?), we omit them from the data frame with the filter() function. mpg_rev &lt;- mpg %&gt;% filter(cyl != 5) The characters != is “not equal to” the pipe operator %&gt;% can be read “then” ggplot(data = mpg_rev, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(vars(cyl), nrow = 1) "]
