[Pre-Institute Workshop Agenda](#day0agenda)       

This is an **optional session** designed for R novices. If you cannot attend this session on Sunday, you are welcome to work these tutorials on your own before the Monday/Tuesday sessions. 

The tutorials give the R novice a quick introduction to three essential elements of data science using R:

- [R basics](#r-basics) 
- [Graph basics](#graph-basics) 
- [Data basics](#data-basics) 

The tutorials are designed to be completed by an R novice in less than 50 minutes each. The timing has been student-tested, but of course your mileage may vary.
