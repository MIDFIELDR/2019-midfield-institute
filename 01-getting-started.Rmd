# Getting started {#getting-started}

Unless noted otherwise, we assume throughout that the workshop attendee is an R novice. Thus the first steps are to install R and RStudio. 

- Install R for your OS: <https://cloud.r-project.org> 
- Install RStudio, a user interface for R:  <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop> 

If you already have R and RStudio installed, please update to the most recent release and update your R packiages as well.
