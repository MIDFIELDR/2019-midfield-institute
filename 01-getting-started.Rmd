If you are joining us for the first time, it is vital that you attempt to set up your computer with the necessary software in advance or it will be difficult to keep up. 

Unless noted otherwise, we assume the reader is an R novice. Thus the first steps are to install R and RStudio. 






## Install R and RStudio {-}

Windows users may have to login as an Administrator (localmgr) before installing the software. 

- Install R for your OS: <https://cloud.r-project.org> 
- Install RStudio, a user interface for R:  <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop> 

If you already have R and RStudio installed, please update to the most recent releases and update your R packages as well. 

If you need additional assistance for Mac OS or Linux, these links might be useful

## Installing an R package {-}

For the R novice, an R package is like an "app" for R---a collection of functions, data, and documentation for doing work in R. Most packages are obtained from the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) website (the Comprehensive R Archive Network). 

- Launch RStudio 

The RStudio interface has several panes. 


```{r}
include_graphics("images/open-rstudio-packages.png")
```

We use the RStudio *Packages* feature to install packages from CRAN. 

- Select the *Packages*  tab 
- Click *Install* on the ribbon 
- In the dialog box, type **drat** (a package we'll use in a moment) 
- Check the *Install dependencies* box 
- Click the  *Install* button 
- Repeat to install the package **devtools**






## Installing midfielddata and midfieldr {-}

The **midfielddata** package is too large to be stored in CRAN, so we use a special "drat-repository" to make the package source files available.

To install the packages, place your cursor in the RStudio *Console* pane. 

```{r}
include_graphics("images/open-rstudio-console.png")
```

In the console, at the cursor (indicated by  `>`), type each of the following lines of code and press *Enter* from your keyboard, one line at a time. Alternatively, you can copy a line of code from this page, paste it in the console, and press *Enter*. We only run these lines of code once, so you do not have to type the lines into a script. 

 
```
drat::addRepo("midfieldr") 
```

```
install.packages("midfielddata") 
```

We use the devtools `install_github()` function to install midfieldr from it's GitHub repository because  midfieldr has not yet been submitted to CRAN. 

```
devtools::install_github("MIDFIELDR/midfieldr") 
```

If you have successfully installed the software and packages, you are ready for the workshop!
