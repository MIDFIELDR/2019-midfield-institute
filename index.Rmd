This site provides access to workshop materials for studying how undergraduate students maneuver through their curricula using MIDFIELD data  [@2016ohlandlong]. The software environment is R [-@2018rcoreteam] and RStudio [-@2016rstudio]. 

- [**MIDFIELD**](https://engineering.purdue.edu/MIDFIELD) (*Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development*) is a partnership of higher education institutions with engineering programs. MIDFIELD contains student record data from 1988--2017 for approximately one million undergraduate, degree-seeking students at the partner institutions.
- [**midfielddata**](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/) is an R package that provides a stratified sample of the MIDFIELD data. This data package contains student records for 98,000 students, suitable for practice with the midfieldr package. 
- [**midfieldr**](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/) is a R package that provides functions for turning student-record data into persistence metrics. 

## Why R? {-}

R is an open source language and environment for statistical computing and graphics [@2018rcoreteam], ranked by IEEE in 2018 as the 7th most popular programming language (Python, C++, and Java are the top three) [@2018Cass]. If you are new to R, some of its best features, paraphrasing Wickham  [-@wickham2014advanced], are: 


- R is free, open source, and available on every major platform, making it easy for others to replicate your work.
- More than 13,000 open-source R packages are available (October 2018). Many are cutting-edge tools. 
- R packages provide deep-seated support for data analysis, e.g., missing values, data frames, and subsetting.
- R packages provide powerful tools for communicating results via html, pdf, docx, or interactive websites.
- It is easy to get help from experts in the R community.


RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, includes a console, editor, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management as well as access to GitHub for collaboration and version control  [@2016rstudio]. 



## Facilitators {-}

**Matthew Ohland** is the MIDFIELD Director and Principal Investigator. He is Professor and Associate Head of Engineering Education at Purdue University.

**Marisa Orr** is the MIDFIELD Associate Director and Assistant Professor in Engineering and Science Education with a joint appointment in Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University. 

**Russell Long** is MIDFIELD Managing Director and Data Steward. He developed the stratified data sample for the R packages used in this workshop.

**Susan Lord** is Director of the MIDFIELD Institute and Professor and Chair of Engineering and Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of San Diego.

**Richard Layton** is the MIDFIELD Director of Data Display and Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Rose-Hulman. He is the lead developer of the R packages used in this workshop.
