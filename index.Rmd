This site provides access to workshop materials for studying how undergraduate students maneuver through their curricula using data from the MIDFIELD project [@2016ohlandlong].  

The software environment for statistical computing and graphics is R [-@2018rcoreteam] and RStudio [-@2016rstudio]. 


- **MIDFIELD** is the *Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development*---a student record database with approximately one million undergraduate students at sixteen US institutions from 1987 to 2016.  
- **midfieldr** is a R package that provides functions for turning raw MIDFIELD data into persistence metrics.  
- **midfielddata** is an R package  that provides a stratified sample of the MIDFIELD data: registrars' student records for 98,000 undergraduate students with proportional representation by institution, program, transfer status, sex, and race/ethnicity.
