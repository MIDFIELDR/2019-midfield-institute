This site provides access to workshop materials for studying how undergraduate students maneuver through their curricula using MIDFIELD data  [@2016ohlandlong]. The software environment is R [-@2018rcoreteam] and RStudio [-@2016rstudio]. 

## What is MIDFIELD? {-}

[**MIDFIELD**](https://engineering.purdue.edu/MIDFIELD) (*Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development*) is a partnership of higher education institutions with engineering programs. MIDFIELD contains student record data from 1988--2017 for approximately one million undergraduate, degree-seeking students at the partner institutions.



## What is midfieldr? {-}

Analytical tools for research in student pathways are generally scarce. The R package **midfieldr** provides an entry to this type of intersectional research for anyone willing to develop basic proficiency in R. 

[**midfieldr**](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/) is a R package that provides functions for turning student-record data into persistence metrics. 

[**midfielddata**](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/) is an R package that provides a stratified sample of the MIDFIELD data. This data package contains student records for 98,000 students, suitable for practice with the midfieldr package. 



## Why R? {-}

```{r eval = FALSE}
# if internet available, find and save current number of R packages
if (pingr::is_online()) {
	n_pkg <- nrow(available.packages(contrib.url("https://cloud.r-project.org/")))
	# round down to nearest 250
	n_pkg <- 250 * floor(n_pkg / 250)
	n_pkg <- format(n_pkg, big.mark = ",", trim = TRUE, digits = 0, scientific = FALSE)
	saveRDS(n_pkg, "data/n_pkg.rds")
}
# use saved number 
n_pkg <- readRDS("data/n_pkg.rds")

# The variety of R packages (more than `r n_pkg` as of `r Sys.Date()`), many of them cutting edge tools.
```




R is an open source language and environment for statistical computing and graphics [@2018rcoreteam], ranked by IEEE in 2018 as the 7th most popular programming language (Python, C++, and Java are the top three) [@2018Cass]. If you are new to R, some of its best features, paraphrasing Wickham  [-@wickham2014advanced], are: 


- R is free, open source, and available on every major platform, making it easy for others to replicate your work.
- More than 14,000 open-source R packages are available (April 2019). Many are cutting-edge tools. 
- R packages provide deep-seated support for data analysis, e.g., missing values, data frames, and subsetting.
- R packages provide powerful tools for communicating results via html, pdf, docx, or interactive websites.
- It is easy to get help from experts in the R community.


RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, includes a console, editor, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management as well as access to GitHub for collaboration and version control  [@2016rstudio].
