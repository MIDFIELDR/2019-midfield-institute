Workshop conducted at the 2018 Frontiers in Education Conference (2018-10-03) in San Jose, CA. 

The goal of the workshop is to share our data, methods, and metrics for intersectional research in student persistence. The workshop is designed for R beginners.

See the [Preface](https://midfieldr.github.io/workshops/index.html) for an introduction to MIDFIELD and the workshop facilitators. 

See [Getting started](https://midfieldr.github.io/workshops/getting-started.html) for pre-workshop software installation instructions. 


## Description  {-}

The goal of the workshop is to make MIDFIELD more accessible to the FIE community via **midfieldr**. On completing the workshop, participants should be able to 

- Describe key variables in the MIDFIELD data 
- Select academic programs and populations to study
- Compute persistence metrics (e.g.\ graduation rate) 
- Graph persistence metrics
- Explain key features of effective data displays 


Participants should be sufficiently familiar with their operating systems to install software and navigate directories, but prior experience with R is not required. 

Participants work on self-paced software tutorials, learning some basic R plus the specialized **midfieldr** functions for turning raw MIDFIELD data into persistence metrics. In the graduation rate tutorial for example, we select specific academic programs to study, determine the numbers of students who matriculate and graduate in a program, compute graduation rates, and graphically compare the results across different programs, disaggregating by sex and race/ethnicity. Participants learn some basic R, but the majority of the analysis is performed using functions in the package specialized for this data and type of analysis. 

The agenda also includes an interactive session demonstrating contemporary principles of effective data display. The goal of this segment is to provide the rationale underlying the default graph types used in the package. 

The workshop aligns with FIE faculty development goals by improving participantsâ€™ abilities to explore data and communicate findings using an intersectional approach. The workshop goals also align with the 2018 FIE conference theme of ``Fostering Innovation through Diversity.'' 

## Agenda  {-}

Workshop activities include think-pair share, active learning, demonstration, discussion, and self-paced software tutorials. Our 3-hour agenda includes: 

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
df <- tribble(
  ~ Min, ~Topic, 
   10, "Introductions", 
   30, "Designing effective data displays (interactive)", 
   20," Getting started with R (interactive)", 
   20, "Break", 
   20, "Exploring the structure of the MIDFIELD data sample", 
   45, "Using R for persistence metrics (self-paced tutorial)", 
   15, "Additional persistence metrics using R", 
   20, "Discussing next steps and assessing the workshop"
  )
kable(df)
```



## Sample result {-}

A common example of a persistence metric is graduation rate: the fraction of starters in a major who graduate in the major. The figure shows graduation rates for students in three majors---Industrial Engineering (ISE), Mechanical Engineering (MCE), and Electrical Engineering (ELE)---disaggregated by sex and race/ethnicity. 

```{r out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "Graduation rates of students in three engineering majors."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fig2_fie1.png")
```

The rows of this graph are ordered by the mean graduation rate of each student group across all three panels, allowing us to detect visual anomalies. For example, Hispanic Female students in ISE graduate at a much higher rate than expected given their average rate across all three majors.

Data of this type are *multiway data* and the graph is a *multiway dot plot* [@Cleveland1993]. Because persistence data often have a multiway structure, we regularly use this graph type for data exploration and presentation [@LaytonLord2009] and we include it as a default graph type in **midfieldr**. 

## Summary {-}

Participants leave with the knowledge and skills to access a MIDFIELD student-record data sample and to determine persistence metrics such as graduation rates through a lens of intersectionality. 

Participants who are new to R will take away the ability to use R at a basic level to import data, transform data, and graph results. They will have ``made a start'' with R.

Once introduced to **midfieldr**, participants can continue to learn about data and tools for investigating undergraduate persistence metrics using additional self-paced tutorials publicly available on GitHub [@midfieldr_github].
