```

Workshop conducted at the 2018 Frontiers in Education Conference (2018-10-03) in San Jose, CA. 

The goal of the workshop is to share our data, methods, and metrics for intersectional research in student persistence. The workshop is designed for R beginners.

## Pre-workshop setup {-}

- [Getting started](https://midfieldr.github.io/workshops/getting-started.html) for pre-workshop software installation instructions.
- [Preface](https://midfieldr.github.io/workshops/index.html) for an introduction to MIDFIELD and the workshop facilitators. 
 


## Description {-}

The goal of the workshop is to make MIDFIELD more accessible to the FIE community via **midfieldr**. On completing the workshop, participants should be able to 

- Describe key variables in the MIDFIELD data 
- Select academic programs and populations to study
- Use R to compute and graph persistence metrics (e.g., graduation rate) 
- Explain key features of effective data displays 
- Continue using **midfieldr** to study additional persistence metrics

Participants should be sufficiently familiar with their operating systems to install software and navigate directories, but prior experience with R is not required. Workshop slides can be viewed on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/graphdr/making-midfield-more-accessible-a-workshop-for-r-beginners-8ce7b993-6625-470f-9ca3-35d12b61f05c).

## Tutorial: Getting started with R  {-}

This is a self-paced tutorial. 

- Don't worry about the pace of your  work. 
- Everyone works and learns new material at a different pace. 
- Please ask questions of your neighbors as well as the facilitators 
- If you finish early, ask if anyone near you needs assistance 
- Save your work regularly 

**1. Create an R project**

Open RStudio. 

- File > New Project > New Directory > New Project 
- Fill in the Directory Name text box with 2018-FIE-midfieldr-workshop
- Select a location on your computer to save the project  
- Check the *Open in a new session* box 
- Click Create Project 

The new project directory will be all of these things:

- a directory or "folder" on your computer 
- an RStudio Project 

On your computer, if you navigate to the new project folder, you should have at least the following folders and files,

    2018-FIE-midfieldr-workshop/
        |-- 2018-FIE-midfieldr-workshop.Rproj

Always begin an R work session by opening the project's Rproj file. Let's practice:

- First, close all RStudio windows 
- Navigate to the workshop folder you jst created 
- Open `2018-FIE-midfieldr-workshop.Rproj`

We work within an R project because it automatically sets project directory as the R *working directory*. 

Set project options from the Tools pulldown menu

- Tools > Global Options 
- *Restore RData into workspace at startup*:  Uncheck this box 
- *Save workspace to RData on exit*:  Set to Never

```{r}
htmltools::img(src = 
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-workspace.png"), 
               alt = 'rstudio tools global options window', 
               width = 500)
```


Optional reading: To read all about R Projects, see the [RStudio support page](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects).




**2. Create an R script**

If you closed the project, then open `2018-FIE-midfieldr-workshop.Rproj` 

- File > New File > R Script 
- An Untitled script will open 
- File > Save As 
- Type in a file name, for example, `get-started.R`
- Save 

In this workshop, all files we create will be saved in the main project folder, with no subdirectories. If you prefer to use subdirectories (folders) inside the project, that's OK. 

In the R file, type 

    library(tidyverse)



To run the script, 

- Save 
- Click the *Run* button to run a selected line or lines of code
- Click *Source* to run the entire script 


```{r}
htmltools::img(src = 
knitr::include_graphics("images/run-source.png"), 
               alt = 'showing the run and source buttons', 
               width = 600)
```

Notes 

- If you get an error statement that the package does not exist, you probably have to install the package. In the RStudio, console, just type `install.packages("tidyverse")` 
- Sometimes when clicking Source, a plot is not sent to the output. If that happens, 

When the script runs correctly, you should see set of messages like this, 


```
-- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.2.1 --
v ggplot2 3.0.0.9000     v purrr   0.2.5     
v tibble  1.4.2          v dplyr   0.7.6     
v tidyr   0.8.1          v stringr 1.3.1     
v readr   1.1.1          v forcats 0.3.0     
-- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --
x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

```


Getting help: To see the help page for an R package or function, in your Console type a question mark followed by the object name, e.g., 

    ? tidyverse
    ? library

```{r}
htmltools::img(src = 
knitr::include_graphics("images/library-help-page.png") 
  , alt = 'help page for the library function' 
  , width = 600
)
```

```

```



**3. Look at a tibble**

The tidyverse comes with several data sets. We will use the one called mpg. 

The help page for the data set tells us its source package and explains the variables. 

    ? mpg


```{r}
htmltools::img(src = 
knitr::include_graphics("images/sample-help-page.png") 
  , alt = 'help page for the mpg dataset' 
  , width = 600
)
```


To get a glimpse of the data, just type its name in the script and run it. In this tutorial, R output is indicated by a double hashtag (`##`). 

```{r echo = TRUE}
# mpg is a data frame included in the tidyverse package
mpg
```

The result tells us that the data has 

- `r nrow(mpg)` observations (rows) 
- `r ncol(mpg)` variables (columns)  
- `r names(mpg)[1]` is a variable of type  "`r typeof(mpg[[1]])`" 
- `r names(mpg)[3]` is a variable of type  "`r typeof(mpg[[3]])`" 
- `r names(mpg)[4]` is a variable of type  "`r typeof(mpg[[4]])`" 



*Data frames* are the most common way of storing data in R: a 2-dimensional data structure with columns of equal lengths. Columns can be of different types (numeric, character, logical, etc.) but all values in a column are the same type. Optional reading: [Data frames](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html#data-frames). 

In a *tidy* data frame, every column is a variable and every row is an observation. The `mpg` data is in tidy form. 

The output above tells us that `mpg` is a *tibble*. Tibbles are data frames, but they tweak some older behaviors to make life a little easier.  Optional reading: [Tibbles](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html).




**4. Assignment operator**

In R we assign values to objects with the assignment operator, `<-`. For example, suppose we want to assign the value $\pi$ to the object $x$. 

```{r echo = TRUE}
# an angle in radians
x <- pi
```

Type the object name `x` to see it's value. 

```{r echo = TRUE}
x
```




**5. Functions** 

Functions are fundamental building blocks in R. Functions carry out specified tasks, typically operating on one or more arguments. For example, the cosine function, `cos()`, has one argument, 

```{r echo = TRUE}
cos(x)
```

The help page for a function is found by typing (in the RStudio console pane) a question  mark followed by the function name. For example, `?cos()`. 

A function from the tidyverse that we will use regularly is `glimpse()`. It gives us a useful glimpse of a data frame, showing all the variables (column names) but written down the page, and data runs across the page. making it possible to see every column in a data frame. 

For example, 

```{r echo = TRUE}
glimpse(mpg)
```

The general form of a function is 

```
function_name(arg1 = value, arg2 = value, ... )
```



**6. Graphs** 


We use the `ggplot()` function from the tidyverse for creating graphs. 


For example, add the following lines to your script and run the code. 

- Sometimes when clicking Source, a plot is not sent to the output. If that happens, select all the code lines and press Run

```{r echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
```

`ggplot()` arguments:

- argument is `data` to which we assign the data frame `mpg`  
- argument `mapping` to which we assign the aesthetics `aes()` function 
- arguments of `aes()` are `x` and `y` to which we assign the value of the `displ` and `hwy` variables from the data frame 
- `+` adds a new layer to the graph 
- `geom_point()` assigns points as the data markers 



**7. Saving results to a file** 

We can save any result to file, for example, to save the graph we just made as a PNG image, we write 


    ggsave("mileage.png")


To save a data frame as a CSV file, 


    write_csv(mpg, "mpg_data.csv")


Add these lines to your script and run it. If you examine your project folder you will find the PNG and CSV files your just made.  Your directory should look like this now, 


    2018-FIE-midfieldr-workshop/
        |-- get-started.R
        |-- mpg_data.csv
        |-- mileage.png
        |-- 2018-FIE-midfieldr-workshop.Rproj


**8. Small multiple graphs** 

We can use a 3rd variable from the data frame, the variable `class`, as a conditioning variable to create a set of small multiples (called *facets* in ggplot). The new graph layer is created using the `facet_wrap()` function. 


```{r echo = TRUE, fig.asp = 1, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(class))
```


Or, instead of class, we could condition using the number of cylinders in the engine. 


```{r echo = TRUE, fig.asp = 1, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(cyl))
```

If we aren't interested in 5-cylinder cars (?), we omit them from the data frame with the `filter()` function. Filter is a row-operation.  The following code could be stated, "Start with `mpg`, assign it to the new object `mpg_rev`, then, filter to keep all rows in which the `cyl` variable is not equal to 5."


```{r  echo=TRUE}
mpg_rev <- mpg %>% 
  filter(cyl != 5)
```

- The characters `!=` is "not equal to"
- the pipe operator `%>%` can be read "then" 


```{r echo=TRUE, fig.asp = 5/12, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = mpg_rev, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(cyl), nrow = 1)
```

The  `nrow = 1` argument places the panels of the graphs all in one row. 





**8. Smooth curve** 

Adding the `geom_smooth()` layer adds a loess curve (a local regression) to each panel. 

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.asp = 5/12, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = mpg_rev, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(cyl), nrow = 1) + 
  geom_smooth()
```


If we want to try a linear regression , add the argument  `method - "lm"`


```{r echo=TRUE, fig.asp = 5/12, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = mpg_rev, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(cyl), nrow = 1) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

The shaded area around the regression is the confidence interval. We can remove it using the argument `se = FALSE`. 

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.asp = 5/12, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = mpg_rev, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(cyl), nrow = 1) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```





**9. Labels** 

We can change the axis labels and add a title (above the figure)  and a caption (below the figure) using the `labs()` layer. Type `?mpg` to find out that the engine displacement is in liters. 


```{r echo=TRUE, fig.asp = 6/12, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = mpg_rev, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(cyl), nrow = 1) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Engine displacement (liters)", 
       y = "Highway mileage (mpg)",
       title = "Fuel economy of popular cars, 1199--2008",
       caption = "EPA http://fueleconomy.gov")
```
